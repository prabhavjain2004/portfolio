# About Prabhav Jain

## Professional Summary

I am a third-year B.Tech student in Computer Science and Engineering (AIML specialization) at Jain (Deemed-to-be) University, Bangalore. My professional identity is centered around **Automation Engineering** and **AI Workflow Design** — specifically, building AI-powered automation systems that eliminate friction from real-world processes.

My biggest motivation is **removing repetitive tasks** that slow people down. I'm constantly identifying inefficiencies in day-to-day workflows and asking, "Why can't this be automated?" My approach is simple: **observe → understand the real bottleneck → think deeply → build fast → deploy → iterate**.

I obsess over processes with repeated manual steps, redundant checks, and human-driven coordination. Rather than pursuing pure theory or traditional ML model building, I'm drawn to **applied automation engineering** where tangible execution and outcomes matter more than architectural complexity. I value **execution speed over theoretical perfection**.

Current focus areas include:
- Automating hiring workflows to evaluate and onboard interns efficiently
- Streamlining campus processes (e.g., hostel mess verification/signature flow)
- Building real-time automation pipelines and AI agent systems
- Exploring corporate automation environments

I'm highly execution-driven — if something takes days manually, I want to automate it to run in minutes. I consistently learn tools as needed and love operational problem-solving more than theoretical algorithm design. Collaboration plays a big role in my thinking process: **speaking ideas out loud and refining them with feedback** is how I work best.

**My motto:** Build fast, ship real, iterate smarter.
